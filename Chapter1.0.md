Transaction is used to alter data stored on the Blockchain, a small fee must be paid to perform it.

Script is used to view data stored on the Blockchain, no fees have to be paid.

## Day 2

**1) What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**

* Safety and Security: strong type system.
* Clarity: code easy to read.
* Approachability: similar to other programming languages.
* Developer Experience: easy debug.
* Resource Oriented Programming: uses resources.

**2) In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?**

These 5 pillars guarantee unique features to Cadence and ensure that new Web3 programmers are encouraged to use Cadence over Solidity or other smart contract languages.
